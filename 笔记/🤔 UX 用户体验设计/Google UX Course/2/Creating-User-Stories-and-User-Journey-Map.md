Creating user stories and user journey map

In this part of the course, we'll continue to explore some of the ways UX designers build empathy with users of the products they designed for. We'll start with user stories which are fictional, one sentence stories that connect the needs of a potential user to a specific action and benefit. After that, you'll learn about user journey maps, a tool used by UX designers to understand the obstacles a user faces while interacting with a product. Lastly, we'll explore some strategies for keeping accessibility top of mind during the empathize phase of the design process. So let's get started.

 A user story is a fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. It introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states their ultimate goal.

 ## Advantages of user stories

 - Prioritize design goals
 - Unite the team
 - Inspire empathetic design decisions
 - Personalize pitches to stakeholders

User stories also unite the team around a clear goal. A good user story can also inspire empathetic design decisions by making our approach user-centered, also known as user-centric. And finally, user stories personalize pitches to stakeholders. You aren't just presenting your design update ideas. You're demonstrating how the updates will help specific types of people. So how do you write a user story? Like a classic short story, user stories have a hero with an ultimate goal and a conflict that keeps them from conquering that goal. To write a user story, we follow this simple formula. As a type of user, I want to action, so that benefit. All that's left now is filling in the missing pieces. Type of user describes who we are designing for. Action is what the user hopes will happen. And finally, benefit is why the user wants the action to happen. This formula keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear. Let's think about a user story that I experience all the time. As an online shopper, I want to receive a text when the item arrives so that I can pick it up right away. So now you know what a user story is, why it's important, and how it's structured. Up next, you'll learn how to predict and prevent a bad user experience.

## Edges Cases
An edge case is a rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience. Good UX anticipates edge cases and reroute users back to the happy path when things don't go as planned. In edge cases, the obstacle is often beyond the user's control to fix.

## Consider accessibility

Hi again. You just learned about personas, user stories, and user journeys. I'm here to help you learn how to consider accessibility in each of these. Why do we need to consider personas, user stories, and user journeys of someone with a disability? Well, people with disabilities share the same goal for any given user problem that your design is trying to solve.

Additionally, accessibility is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities. Instead, it extends to anyone who is experiencing a permanent, temporary, or situational disability. Designing with accessibility in mind means making sure, Betty, a user with only one arm; Angela, a user with a sprained wrist; and Juan, a user holding a colicky newborn, all have everything they need to stay happily on their user journeys. Betty's disability is permanent, Angela's is temporary, and Juan's is situational, but they all need to achieve their user goal with only one hand. You want to design products that can be used by everyone. As UX designers, we don't want to leave Betty, Angela, or Juan behind.
